This application is a simple course table.

The first page showing the course table, and there are to buttons, one is used to add course, other one is used to exit.

When click the add button, will skip to add course page. Users can type the details of course, and click the add button to save that.

Then page will skip back to course table, and the change will be shown(but it not, I don't know why the data can not be present).

Please forgive me for doing so bad, but I hope you can tell me why it doesn't work.

Thanks million.
